				<h2>Semi-Autonomous Car</h2>
				<p>With Speech Recognition</p>
			</header>

			<p>Role: Coding and Integration in Python and C</p>

			<p>Data Processing: Record sample voice commands, Examine envelope of different commands, PCA + Classifier (3 commands), Check accuracy, PCA projection on Launchpad

			</p>Integration: Control speed and direction using PCA projection

			<p>This semi-autonomous car was controlled by recognizing commands when spoken to. It involved five major parts: building a framework for principal component analysis, making a usable microphone system, using the PCA model framework to collect data using the microphone system, making a control model and a car, and integrating all the aforementioned systems.

			<p>A framework for principal component analysis (PCA) was made using a prebuilt microphone. This involved finding out which words would work the best and coding the process of recognizing words using PCA.Then using k-means algorithm to classify the different words that make at least 80% correctly on all four words.
